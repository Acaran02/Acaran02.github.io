Hi there!

I've put this website together as my personal blog hosted in Github. It was surprisingly easy (and fun) to do!

In doing this I've learned:
- the basics of `Git` and `GitHub`
- creating `repositories`, `directories`, and `files` in Github
- basics of setting up a `GitHub Page`
- basics of `markdown` for writing posts (I'm using [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#) an online wysiwyg markdown editor)

special thanks to [jmcglone.com](http://jmcglone.com/) for putting together this beginner-friendly guide to **creating and hosting a website on GitHub**. [Check it out](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) here if you're interested to launch your own.

The site is very barebones right now but I actually like how minimal the overall look and feel is.

I'm hoping to use this platform to publish personal projects I'm working, *significantly* cut down on how much I'm spending on web hosting, document new skills and learning notes, and a space to post the occasional random 'stream-of-thought' blog post.

## Next Steps

 1. setup this site to point to my `custom domain` (roncarandang.com)
 2. improve the site's 'look and feel' with some CSS styling
 3. [Add pagination on the blog](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/)
 4. [Setup a sitemap.xml file (for SEO)](https://help.github.com/articles/sitemaps-for-github-pages)
 5. wrap my head around implementing [Jekyll](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) 
 6. Start writing some blog posts
